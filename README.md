IOT BASED SMART ENERGY METER USING GSM WITH HELP OF ARDUINO 
The demand for power has increased exponentially with time. 
One avenue through which today's energy problems can be address through the reduction of energy usage in households.
This has increased the emphasis on the need for accurate and economic methods of power measurement. 
The goal of providing such data is to optimize and reduce their power consumption. This paper presents a smart 
energy meter for an automatic and superior metering and billing system. 
The integration of the Arduino and GSM Short Message Service (SMS) provide the meter reading system with some automatic
functions that are predefined.
The proposed energy meter system can incorporate with embedded controller and GSM modem to transmit the data like consumed 
energy in kWh, generated bill, 
security services (line Cut/On) over GSM mobile network such as data can be then fed and integrated into existing energy management 
systems located at power companies or organizations to provide the services among the customers without man-power

COMPONENTS USED:
1. ARDUINO
2. ESP8266 WIFI MODULE
3. GSM MODULE
4. ENERGY METER
